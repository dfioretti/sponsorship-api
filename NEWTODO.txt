filter by tag to create asset set


WORKS FOR SIDEBYSIDE COMPARE

Create New Dashboard:
  [ ] Create drops you in a new dashboard
  [ ] Maybe Just a Modal that you give it a name
        - then it drops you there
  [ ] On back of all cards, have the option to add to board
  [ ] Then Just iterate through all and render...
      Only issue is same boards on different - maybe I add
      a feild alled custom board - and that one uses
      a json string that takes an
        portfolio/asset, asset_id, a card name,

Porfolio Dashboard:
  [ ] Create portoflio detail card:
        - tall, has portoflio assets
        - filter, sort -> basic stats
        - can reuse some componenet i think
  [ ] Tall Score Standing for built in score
        - can link to a madeup demo score
        - should have a ranking bar (risk indicators)
  [ ] Portfolio Summary ? - spend breakdown by category
        - can be a detail view of the tree map?
  [ ] Portfolio Map
        - can be jsut regional?
        - toggle category, individual assets
        - cencus heatmap?
        - detail is just larger map - side container to toggle
  [ ] Create Dashboard -
        - select existing cards
        - actually not too hard...just render
        - eh interface might be annoying...
        - Asset Components - set asset
        - portolio componenets 

Asset Dashboard:
  [ ] Portfolio Rank - risk assessment - single score
  [ ] Social Breakdown
        - pie or doughnut of social followers
  [ ] Bar Chart
        - different scores
        - passion, performance, fit?
  [ ] Line Chart
        - social engagement
  [ ] Tall Survey - lost of demos

Both:
  [ ] Notes
  [ ] Top Tweets / Recent Tweets?
  [ ] Contract data ?
  [ ] Detail views...
  [ ] Configure custom componenet?
        - gear to change
        - interval, [bar/line], [pie/doughnut]
Issues:
  [ ] Fix Editors New
        - don't create new records on edit
  [ ] Fix Navigation
        - get consistent, use details
  [ ] Cut out Old Code
        - get rid of unused code in copied componenets
  [ ] Consistent Nav / Sidebars
        - does the sidbar not work outside of portofolio
  [ ] Connect Real Data
        - Save in DB all data (datum)
        - create a single entry, do diff for
        - national / regional (essentially just teams)
        - set bounds for random # generation
        - setup mock data controllers
  [ ] Connect create componenet
        - get sidebars working,
        - render all components for dash
  [ ] Menu Subs
        - contextual menu
        - grouped submenus
        - fake menu items -> Manage Data
                          -> Upload Data
  [ ] Fip Card to Configure
        - i like in line updating
        - some can be mocked - use flip

  [ ] Detail Views!
        - at least something?
